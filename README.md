## inreach message utils

Super quick hacks to provide more useful data for inreach messaging analysis when using an enterprise plan. Mostly to work around the Garmin UI not filtering message types properly when exporting to KML :tableflip:

You'll get two files `out.kml` and `out.csv` in the working directory. Nothing super exciting.
